The anger expression in the upper face is created through the lowering of the eyebrows (Procerus, Depressor Supercilli, and Corrugator muscles [AU4]) and the tensing of the upper eyelids (Levator Palpebrae Superioris muscle [AU5]) with the lower eyelids tensed (Orbicularis Oculi Pars Palebralis muscle [AU7]) causing a glare to be made. The nostrils may also be flared, but this is an optional expression (Nasalis Transversa [AU38]). In the lower face, the lips are pressed together (Orbicularis Oris muscle [AU23]), not sucked in, to make the lips appear more horizontal or straighter in nature.
