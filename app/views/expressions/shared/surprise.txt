The surprise expression occurs quite quickly by nature and then motions into another facial expression. The eyebrows in surprise will rise to make a curved arch (Frontalis muscle [AU1 + AU2]) and the jaw will often relax and drop (Masetter muscle with Temporal and Internal Pterygoid muscles relaxed [AU26]), causing the lips and teeth to part (Depressor Labii muscle or relaxation of Mentalis or Orbicularis Oris muscles [AU25]) due to these relaxations. In the eyes, the upper eyelids will become raised (Levator Palprae Superioris muscle [AU5]) revealing the sclera, while the lower eyelids will stay relaxed.
