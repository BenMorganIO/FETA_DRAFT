In happiness, there is a stretching of the lips in an upward movement (Zygomatic Major muscle [AU12]) with the expresser possibly parting their lips (Depressor Labii muscle or relaxation of Mentalis or Orbicularis Oris muscle [AU25]) and showing their teeth. Crow feet form (Naso-Labial Fold) as the cheek rises (Orbicularis Oculi Pars Orbitalis muscle [AU6]). If the expression is intense, the eyebrows will motion downwards due to the movement of the eyes (Orbicularis Oculi Pars Orbitalis muscle [AU4]). In unfelt happiness, the lips are pulled by the Zygomatic Minor muscle rather than the Zygomatic Major muscle.
