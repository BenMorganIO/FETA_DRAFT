  As you click through the six basic emotions, you'll be introduced to the selected emotion at its maximum expression.
  Every section teaches you how to recognize the emotion through a qualitative means by presenting the relevant codes from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and the relevant muscles used.
  The FACS is a coding system developed to help scientists quantitatively define facial movements through a non-SI dimensional quantity called Action Units (AU).
  The Muscle and AU option will give you the ability to see the expression with the muscles and AUs laid out on top of the selected emotion.
